<p>The first version of this game project was finished  in  GGJ2022,	The theme of gamejam is “<strong>Duality</strong>“ The first version                         contains  5 levels. After 5 months, I iterated on version 2.0, adding a new puzzle mechanic, and the game ended up having 2 large chapters with 8 levels in total.</p>
<h2 id="Game-Concept"><a href="#Game-Concept" class="headerlink" title="Game Concept"></a>Game Concept</h2><p>The plot of the game is roughly about a cow cat of the hostess who mistakenly entered the dimension and split into a black cat that can move in three dimensions and a white cat that can only move in two dimensions.</p>
<p>The two cats will cooperate with each other to defeat the enemies, get the key to open the door and finally return to their mistress!</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPviXOf"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPviXOf.jpg" alt="pPviXOf.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="Game-play"><a href="#Game-play" class="headerlink" title="Game play"></a>Game play</h2><h3 id="Chapter-I"><a href="#Chapter-I" class="headerlink" title="Chapter I"></a>Chapter I</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPjh2He"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPjh2He.png" alt="pPjh2He.png"></a></p>
<h3 id="Chapter-II"><a href="#Chapter-II" class="headerlink" title="Chapter II"></a>Chapter II</h3><p>Based on the gameplay of the first chapter, I found that the white cat has a lot less freedom of action than the black cat, and cannot jump freely, get keys, and defeat enemies like the black cat. So I added an ability to the white cat: you can switch the color of a special brick at any time</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPj4AUJ"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPj4AUJ.png" alt="pPj4AUJ.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="Level-design"><a href="#Level-design" class="headerlink" title="Level design"></a>Level design</h2><h3 id="Lock-amp-Key"><a href="#Lock-amp-Key" class="headerlink" title="Lock &amp; Key"></a>Lock &amp; Key</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPj2XSf"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPj2XSf.png" alt="pPj2XSf.png"></a></p>
<p>In the first level, I want the player to find their own way to get the key, open the door, and finally clear the level.</p>
<p>This design also follows each subsequent level</p>
<h3 id="Mutiple-Routes"><a href="#Mutiple-Routes" class="headerlink" title="Mutiple Routes"></a>Mutiple Routes</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPjRZXF"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPjRZXF.png" alt="pPjRZXF.png"></a></p>
<p>Because it is the last level of the first chapter, I want to test the player’s puzzle solving skills on the one hand, and guide the player to discover the hidden speed run route on the other hand.</p>
<p>Players can choose not to get the key, directly from the middle of the map, and use advanced jumping skills to finally clear the level.</p>
<p>Of course, players can also get two keys, open two doors, and finally clear the level.</p>
<h3 id="Backtracking"><a href="#Backtracking" class="headerlink" title="Backtracking"></a>Backtracking</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPjRyjS"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPjRyjS.png" alt="pPjRyjS.png"></a></p>
<p>There is a key placed next to the monster, but the monster moves quickly, it is difficult for the black cat and the white cat to get the sword directly, kill the monster to get the key, so the black cat and the white cat need to cooperate with each other, avoid the patrol of the two monsters, get the sword in the middle of the map, and then turn back to kill the monster.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPjWmgf"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/07/pPjWmgf.png" alt="pPjWmgf.png"></a></p>
<p>In the third level, the black cat needs to get two keys to open the door, but because the base jump height of the black cat is only 2 blocks, it will be found that the black cat cannot return normally.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese folk saying called “cats have nine lives”, in the game, the cat will return to the starting point after encountering a spike death, and the player can use the death mechanism to return to the starting point, and it is easy to find the route at this time!</p>

<p>Results：</p>
<p>DDL lab is a simulator game created at Ld51, which ended up playing well, ranking 26th globally in innovation and 366th globally in overall rankings.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/piCe2vT"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/16/piCe2vT.png" alt="piCe2vT.png"></a></p>
<h3 id="Gameplay"><a href="#Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay:"></a>Gameplay:</h3><p>The game mechanism is relatively simple, each marble represents a schedule, I need to shoot the marble to the timeline, the schedule represented by the marble determines the player’s stress, the mood of multiple dimensions, the player needs to make a good numerical management, so that the player’s mood and stress in the appropriate range. And if there is too much schedule planning in a day, there may be a timeout penalty.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/piCmeaj"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/16/piCmeaj.png" alt="piCmeaj.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgse.com/i/piCmmIs"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/16/piCmmIs.png" alt="piCmmIs.png"></a></p>
<h3 id="Innovation"><a href="#Innovation" class="headerlink" title="Innovation"></a>Innovation</h3><p>The theme of LD51 is “ <strong>Delay the inevitable</strong>“, during the brainstorming stage, I quickly thought of the common problem of deadline assignments in college students and overtime work in the workplace, so I wanted to make a schedule planning simulator, and at the same time, I wanted to incorporate some interesting terrain of the Chinese Internet, for example, the classic characters of the Chinese Internet such as Ding Zhen, Sun Xiaochuan, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="Version-2-0"><a href="#Version-2-0" class="headerlink" title="Version 2.0"></a>Version 2.0</h3><p>The development program of ddl-lab has been restarted this year to develop version 2.0, which is a great improvement in game strategy and art performance. Based on the original ddl-lab, it will add some special effects for events, as well as some background narratives, which are still under development.</p>

<h2 id="Game-Concept"><a href="#Game-Concept" class="headerlink" title="Game Concept"></a>Game Concept</h2><p>Players will take on the role of an “interstellar mailman” to travel between planets with the help of an ejection bin, overcoming various obstacles, unlocking new cool abilities, exploring unknown worlds in the starry sky, and gradually discovering the truth of the “apocalypse”.</p>
<h2 id="Game-Play"><a href="#Game-Play" class="headerlink" title="Game Play"></a>Game Play</h2><h3 id="Manipulation"><a href="#Manipulation" class="headerlink" title="Manipulation"></a>Manipulation</h3><p>“Easy to understand, hard to master”,  I want players to be able to quickly familiarize themselves with the game’s operation, so I only set up two core keys, jump and roll, and by using jump and roll, many obstacles can be designed against.</p>
<h3 id="Progression-system"><a href="#Progression-system" class="headerlink" title="Progression system"></a>Progression system</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvm8GF"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvm8GF.png" alt="pPvm8GF.png"></a></p>
<p>I’ve set the player’s level into 3 stages, which are upgraded to unlock the appropriate skills. These skills improve the player’s maneuverability, increase fault tolerance (such as giving the player a shield), and all for the player to be able to explore longer and go farther places.</p>
<h2 id="Level-design"><a href="#Level-design" class="headerlink" title="Level design"></a>Level design</h2><h3 id="OASIS"><a href="#OASIS" class="headerlink" title="OASIS"></a>OASIS</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvntfS"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvntfS.png" alt="pPvntfS.png"></a></p>
<p>It is the planet on which the planet messenger primarily works, surrounded by a large amount of green vegetation and a well-developed ecosystem. Similar to Earth’s overall structure and physical system, it has been made an Oasis of the Universe (OASIS) for its safety and pleasant living environment</p>
<p>Obstacles are designed to be very simple, with only ground spikes and hovering objects. Players only need to learn the two basic operations of jumping and rolling to pass all the obstacles when parkouring on this planet. After holding on for 40s and unlocking the ejection capsule, you can shuttle to the next planet.</p>
<h3 id="Rolling-Axe"><a href="#Rolling-Axe" class="headerlink" title="Rolling Axe"></a>Rolling Axe</h3><p>Mountainous planet inhabited by a group of bird people. The terrain is rugged and accompanied by occasional rockfalls. There are many traditional industrial zones as interstellar mines.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvMmWT"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvMmWT.png" alt="pPvMmWT.png"></a></p>
<p>In Planet Rolling Axe, players will need to gradually learn to master some advanced jumping techniques in order to get through obstacles, such as the one in the picture above, which requires the player to maneuver the robot to jump first and then immediately fall down.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvMJFx"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvMJFx.png" alt="pPvMJFx.png"></a></p>
<p>During my testing I realized that the player’s jetpack, which is unlocked later in the game, allows the player to ignore the ground spike obstacle. So I set up boulders that would gradually fall as the player approached, requiring the player to immediately drop and roll to pass.</p>
<h3 id="Crystal-Dream"><a href="#Crystal-Dream" class="headerlink" title="Crystal Dream"></a>Crystal Dream</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvQJBj"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvQJBj.png" alt="pPvQJBj.png"></a></p>
<p>Crystal Dream’s obstacle generation is very dense, is the fastest paced planet, players face dense spikes need to flexibly utilize the two jumps or jetpacks can pass. At the same time, there are shield props available in the suspended obstacles, a typical high-risk, high-yield case show.</p>
<h3 id="Fallen-Stage"><a href="#Fallen-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Fallen Stage"></a>Fallen Stage</h3><p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPv8sRx"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPv8sRx.png" alt="pPv8sRx.png"></a></p>
<p>The obstacles in Apocalypse Planet are very challenging, and obstacles must be two jumped to get over, not with a traditional jetpack.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgse.com/i/pPvGuSx"><img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/08/pPvGuSx.png" alt="pPvGuSx.png"></a></p>
<p>Players also need to use advanced jumping techniques, such as the right side of the map requires players to roll into ball form, and then jump at the right time to enter the passage without injury. The bottom obstacle of the map requires the player to jump twice to reach a high enough height, and then quickly fall into ball form in order to pass.</p>

<p>Measure Card Effect Settlement:<br>Regardless of the number of dice, two successful results will perform the best effect of the card; if there is only one<br>successful result, the middle effect will be performed; if there are no successful dice rolls, the worst effect will be performed.</p>
